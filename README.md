# [badlydr4wn](https://roblox.com)'s Kronos Creations
*"Kronos Creations"* are things I make using the PB Kronos donor perks, aliases and capes. I've made all sorts of things, from rainbow Gamma Swords (gayma swords?) to a police UFO. This wiki will have all my creations so far, either linked or downloadable (command included).

## ‚ùó Important Information

### ‚≠ê Donor Perks
Donor perks are the backbone of most aliases. A command which requires donor perks will be prefixed with `‚≠ê` in front of it. Donor perks can be purchased [here](https://roblox.com). A player who has donor perks will have a small star located above their ranktag in-game. Optionally, boosting an official PB Discord server will grant donor perks in-game, alongside a booster icon above their nametag.

### üïó Command Rate-Limiting/Cooldown
To avoid potential abuse, PB Kronos has a command cooldown. This means that commands cannot be issued in quick session and require a small delay in between execution. The table below contains each Player/Donor command and it's respective cooldown.

| Command       | Cooldown      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `!testcommand`| 0.5s (500ms)  |

### ‚ö† Disclaimer
If you are interested in creating your own "Kronos creations", you can follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository.
1. Delete all capes and repositories, you must replace these with your own work.
1. Edit as you wish. (e.g. "coolguy76's Kronos Creations")
1. Credit me in the repository, under the title by copying the text below;

### ‚è≥ Using the `!wait` command
The `!wait` command servers no purpose when used alone. It is only used in aliases to create a delay to avoid hitting command rate-limits/cooldowns. For example, making a UFO turn red then blue would require `!wait 1` between,  so the code would look like this:

`!rgbufocolor 255 0 0 | !wait 1 | !rgbufocolor 0 0 255`

### ‚öô Built-in Aliases
PB Kronos has some commands built-in which are essentially redirect to another command or execute a command automatically. The table below will contain a list of all built-in aliases and their purpose.

| Command       | Purpose                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------|
| `!help`       | Requests for moderators in your server. |
| `!donate`     | Opens the Donor tab inside of Kronos.   |
| `!client`     | Opens the Home tab inside of Kronos.    |
